# Image-Captioning
My solution to the Image Captioning Project which is a requirement for Udacity's Computer Vision Nano degree

The dataset used is the popular COCO dataset. A Convolutional Neural Network -  Recurrent Neural Network model is used to classify images and to automatically label them. The CNN acts as an encoder to extract features from images and the RNN acts as a decoder that decodes the extracted feature maps to captions.
